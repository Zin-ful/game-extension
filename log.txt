finished world gen
added enemy generation
added position conflic avoidence (checks if any hostile objects are on tree spawns and removes those coords from hostile before finishing generation)
added battle func
improved hostile class
added chat func in sanctuary
*did not make file to store guide chat lines
^^do this to avoid loading hundreds of lines into memory
*conflict between different enemies types exist, dont care
*add error handling if player obj does not exist

bug fixes:
player now collides with obj
fixed "self" reference outside of class for day progression inside freeland func
fixed while loop syntax error (indent) in battle
fixed 2 extra hostile object syntax error
added for loop in hostile_check to loop through hostiles list and compare hostile pos vs player pos
^^^^^^THIS WAS WRONG
added for loop to movement (wasd) to loop through the list and assign each item as an arguent into hostile check instead
seems to work fine for now, more bugs in battle(arg,arg) probably
fixed bad syntax in MakeHostile class
fixed it 4 times
bug in hostile gen, hostile.json is empty meaning the list has no data
^^gen failed
faliure in hostile_gen.json as well
